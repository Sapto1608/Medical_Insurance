Medical Insurance Premium Cost Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict medical insurance premium costs based on various health and demographic factors. By analyzing data from multiple parameters, we strive to build a predictive model that can provide accurate premium cost estimations. This can help insurance companies to set premiums fairly and assist individuals in understanding the potential cost implications of their health conditions.
